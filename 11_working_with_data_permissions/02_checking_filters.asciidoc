=== List Data Permissions

by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You have a project that has the data permissions set up. You would like to review them.

==== Solution
There is no UI that would provide a good overview and API is a little crude but with help of SDK you can get around that.

  GoodData.with_project('project_id') do |project|
    project.data_permissions.pmap {|f| [f.related.login, f.pretty_expression]}
  end
