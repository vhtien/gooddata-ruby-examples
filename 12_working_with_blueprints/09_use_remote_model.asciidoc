=== Working with a remote model
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Notes
- comes out with remote blueprints

==== Problem
Often you are working with a project that was not created using SDK so you do not have a textual representation of the logical model. You would still like to work with it in the same manner as it was a local blueprint.

==== Solution
SDK allows you to get the model of a current project and behind scenes it translates it into a blueprint. Let's have a look at a simplified example how to work with it

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8

require 'gooddata'

client = GoodData.connect
project = GoodData.use('project_id')
blueprint = project.blueprint

# count the number of datasets (does not include date dimensions)
blueprint.datasets.count # => 3

# gives you list of attributes in the whole project
blueprint.fields.select { |x| x[:type].to_s == 'attribute' }

# lists datasets that do have anchor (connection point)
blueprint.datasets.select(&:anchor?)

# Find all the star centers/fact tables (datasets that nobody else connects to)
blueprint.find_star_centers
