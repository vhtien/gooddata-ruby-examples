=== Working with a project in interactive manner
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You want to use SDK on a project but writing a script seems like too much of a hassle.

==== Solution

Use +jack-in+ functionality which sets up an interactive environment for you and logs you in into a specific project.

gooddata -p project_pid -U john.doe@example.com -P secret project jack-in

==== Discussion
You should be in an interactive session where you can evaluate your ideas and verify that everything works in an fast fashion before you put your program in a file that is much more useful for a batch oriented execution
