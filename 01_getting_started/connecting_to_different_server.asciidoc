=== Connecting to different server
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
Sometimes the server you would like to connect is not the secure.goodata.com machine. This might occur for 2 reasons. Either you are trying something on a test machine (if you are working for gooddata) or you are working with a project that is on a white labeled instance.

==== Solution
Solution to both is passing the server name as a pareameter to connect or with_connection functions.

[source,ruby]
----
# encoding: utf-8
require 'gooddata'

GoodData.with_connection(login: 'user',
                         password: 'password',
                         server: 'https://some-other-server.com') do |client|
  # just so you believe us we are printing names of all the project under this account
  client.projects.each do |project|
    puts project.title
  end
end
