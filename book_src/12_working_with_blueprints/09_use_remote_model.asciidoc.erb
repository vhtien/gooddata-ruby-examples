=== Working with a remote model
by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Notes
- comes out with remote blueprints

==== Problem
Often you are working with a project that was not created using SDK so you do not have a textual representation of the logical model. You would still like to work with it in the same manner as it was a local blueprint.

==== Solution
SDK allows you to get the model of a current project and behind scenes it translates it into a blueprint. Let's have a look at a simplified example how to work with it

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/use_remote_model.rb' %>
