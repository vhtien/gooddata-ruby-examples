=== Creating Project from Blueprint

by Tomas Svarovsky

==== Problem
You would like to create a new project with a data model programmatically.

==== Solution

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/creating_project_part1.rb' %>

This created a project with very simple model with just 2 datasets. One is date dimension. The other is a typical fact table. For another more complex example check out the recipe "Working with HR Demo project" which uses many of the features we will explain here.

==== Discussion
Let's have a look at couple of other variations and more complex examples.

===== Defining identifiers
Majority of the objects defined in a blueprint will end up as object in metadata server in the project. Each of these objects has its URI, object id (this number is part of the URI) and identifier which is a textual id. URI and object id are created automatically during creation of a model and you cannot influence them in any way but you have to define the identifiers. This is also the first parameter in majority of the add_... commands. Namely

  add_anchor
  add_label
  add_dataset
  add_fact
  add_attribute

When you see this in the blueprint

  p.add_dataset('dataset.users')

It means that later you would be able to do 

  project.datasets('dataset.users') # this will search all the datasets and returns you the one with identifier 'dataset.users'.

Similarly

[source,ruby]
----
d.add_fact('fact.users.some_number')
----

will result into you be able to do

[source,ruby]
----
project.facts('fact.users.some_number') # this will search all the facts and returns you the one with identifier 'fact.users.some_number'.
----

Identifier can be anything. The only condition is that it has to be unique in the context of a project. No 2 objects may have the same identifier. That being said it is useful to have some kind of convention how you assign the identifiers.

Exception to this rule are references and date_references which we will discuss separately.

===== Defining attributes
When you define attributes through add_attribute you have to remember to add at least one label to that particular attribute

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/creating_project_part2.rb' %>

You can do it like this

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/creating_project_part3.rb' %>

===== Defining anchors/connection_points
Since you might argue that anchor (you might also hear term connection point which means the same thing) is a special case of the attribute lets' talk about it a little. Yes it is true but there are additional things that make it that special one. There can be only one anchor in each dataset

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/creating_project_part4.rb' %>

Anchor is the thing you can reference from other datasets. If you want to do that you have to define a label. Anchor can have multiple labels same as attribute. We strongly recommend not to define anchor with labels on fact tables (they are usually not referenced). The only exception to this rule is if you need to upsert data.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/creating_project_part5.rb' %>

Good question is "why you have to define the anchor if it has no labels?". The reason is that you still need the underlying attribute if you want to construct the count metric for fact table to answer question "How many lines there is in the 'dataset.sales' dataset?". You would do it as follows with SDK (with previous model).

[source,ruby]
----
project.attributes("attr.sales.id").create_metric.execute
----

===== Defining date dimensions
In all tools and even in MAQL date dimensions are represented as single unit (as in blueprint builder add_date_dimension). This is great for readability but might be misleading. The fact is that date dimension is several datasets that contain typically ~18 attributes. If you understand this it is probably not surprising that the parameter to 'add_date_dimension' is not an identifier but a name that will be used in titles and identifiers of all attributes. It is also a name that you can use in add_date function. Here is an example.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/creating_project_part6.rb' %>

===== Defining references
Typically in your model you need to reference other datasets. This is expressed in the blueprint builder with add_reference function. It takes only one parameter which is the identifier of referenced dataset. References do not have identifier since they are not represented as objects on the platform.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/creating_project_part7.rb' %>

===== Defining date references
This is very similar to references but there is additional hint that you are referencing date dimension.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/creating_project_part8.rb' %>

===== Defining Titles
If you would build and open in the browser any of the models we built up to this point you probably noticed that the titles look off. Since we did not define anything SDK tries to do the right thing and tries to use the identifiers (with some tweaking for readability) as titles. While this might work it is usually not what you want. You can easily fix that by defining the titles explicitly.

<%= render_ruby 'src/12_working_with_blueprints/creating_project_part9.rb' %>

===== Specifying data types
Occasionally the default data types of the fields will not be what you want. You can redefine them for both labels and facts as expected with parameter :gd_data_type. There is more information about this in a following recipe.
