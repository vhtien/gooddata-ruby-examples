=== Connecting to GoodData using Single Sign On (SSO)
by Tomas Korcak

==== Problem
You do have SSO enabled and want to use it for logging to GoodData without using username and password.

==== Solution
Using the SSO capability you don’t need to maintain just another password for accessing GoodData application.
You can use your existing infrastructure for user management and connect with GoodData APIs to allow your users login to GoodData seamlessly.

==== Discussion

Never share the your private key with other people. It is the same thing as you name and password. You can do almost everything with it.
